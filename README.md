# Guess the Password

Simple browser game written by [rithmschool](https://github.com/rithmschool/guess_the_password). I refactored the JavaScript to use ES2015 features. I also made some style changes and added an animation to make it easier to notice when the game has ended. You can play the game [here](https://jonkelley88.github.io/guess_the_password/)!
